<h1>Eclipse would exceed the available memory do I have to request for more capacity on supercomputer?</h1>
<p>
You can be using remote Linux machine to run the code.
You can use YOUR Windows machine to view the results and pre process and post process with eclipse and paraview.
</p>

<p>The memory of Linux machine is huge.
The memory of YOUR machine is limited.</p>

<p>To answer your question:
If you did not get a memory error from Linux machine your codes will run good.
If you need to have access to more memory in Linux machine you need to run the code in batch mode and request more memory.
In order to learn how to do this check your cluster's staff's website.</p>

<p>If the memory error is from Eclipse when you want to open the files, the problem is with YOUR machine.
You can use another software to open the .inp or .msh files after you copy these files to YOUR machine.</p>

<p>One nice software for opening huge files is sublime text and you can download it from: http://www.sublimetext.com/</p>

<p>Another way to dear with this problem is to open and edit the files in Linux machine itself.
You can use emacs or vi in Linux machine to view or edit the files.
Check them out to see how to use them:</p>

<h1>How can we install and use Lapack in visual studio?</h1>
<p>You definitely can, I have done it before.</p>
<p>Visual Studio is a proprietary software that cost between 500$ to 5000$ if you have access to it it will be good but there are things that need to know about using VS (Visual Studio)</p>
<p>As long as I know VS does not support gfortran compiler, this means that you have have to purchase a fortran compiler from a vendor that is supported by VS.</p>
<p>VS supports intel fortran or ifort. Intel also provides its own version of lapack and called mkl-lapack.</p>

<p>In summary in order to be able to call lapack subroutines and work with VS you should have access to ifort and mkl-lapack on your system (it is not going to be cheap) and you have to link your source code with mkl-lapack.</p>

<p>The linking process inside VS is a little complicated you have to follow the linking advisor of mkl-lapack and set it based on the version of your fortran and mkl and also your machines architecture.
(https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor)</p>

<p>After finding the correct linking you have to add it to your linking chain in VS.
I have done it once. There was a sub menu in one of the several sub menus of VS (I had problem solving the conflicts between mkl and other packages needed to compile my code in VS I could solve it somehow).</p>

<p>You can check this website for more information but I am almost sure that you have to have different setting based on the your machine and also the version of your compiler: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/</p>

<p>In general even thought it will be possible to run the code on VS i do not recommend it since the time that you might spend in setting up the VS for lapack will be more that you expect.</p>
<p>The other thing about combination VS, ifort and mkl-lapack is that it is not going to be free and it will cost lots of money if you want to install it on your laptop for example.</p>
